      <h1>What is Scrum?</h1>
      <p>
        If you are just getting started, think of Scrum as a way to get work
        done as a team in small pieces at a time, with continuous
        experimentationand feedback loops along the way to learn and improve as
        you go. Scrum helps people and teams deliver value incrementally in a
        collaborativeway. As an agile framework, Scrum provides just enough
        structure for people and teams to integrate into how they work, while
        adding the rightpractices to optimize for their specific needs. You may
        be thinking, that sounds great! But, how do I get started?
      </p>
      <p>
        It starts with understanding the Scrum framework which is defined in The
        Scrum Guide and was first introduced to the world in 1995 as a betterway
        of team collaboration for solving complex problems. The Scrum framework
        is fairly simple being made up of a Scrum Team consisting of aProduct
        Owner, a Scrum Master and Developers, each of which have specific
        accountabilities. The Scrum Team takes part in five events andproduces
        three artifacts. Scrum co-creators Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland
        wrote and maintain The Scrum Guide, which explains Scrum clearlyand
        succinctly. The guide contains the definition of Scrum, describing the
        Scrum accountabilities, events, artifacts and the guidance thatbinds
        them together.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, why is it called Scrum? People often ask, “Is Scrum an acronym for
        something?” and the answer is no. It is actually inspired by a scrum
        inthe sport of rugby. In rugby, the team comes together in what they
        call a scrum to work together to move the ball forward. In this
        context,Scrum is where the team comes together to move the product
        forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scrum is an empirical process, where decisions are based on observation,
        experience and experimentation. Scrum has three pillars:transparency,
        inspection and adaptation. This supports the concept of working
        iteratively. Think of Empiricism as working through smallexperiments,
        learning from that work and adapting both what you are doing and how you
        are doing it as needed.One critical Scrum Team characteristic that binds
        all of the elements together is Trust. If Trust is not present on a
        Scrum Team, there willlikely be tension and bottlenecks in the way of
        getting work done. The Scrum Values are also critical for Scrum Teams to
        adhere to as theyhelp to guide how you work and drive trust . The Scrum
        Values of Courage, Focus, Commitment, Respect, and Openness, are all
        important elementsthat Scrum Team members must consider when working
        together.The Scrum Values are particularly important in environments
        where experimentationis core to making progress.
      </p>
      <p>In a nutshell, Scrum requires an environment where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Increments of valuable work are delivered in short cycles of one month
          or less, which are called Sprints. Ongoing feedbackoccurs during the
          Sprint, allowing for inspection and adaptation of the process and what
          will be delivered.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Scrum Team has a Scrum Master, a Product Owner and Developers, who
          are accountable for turning the selection of the workinto an Increment
          of value during a Sprint.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Scrum Team and other members of their organization, business,
          users or customer-base known as stakeholders, inspect theresults of
          the Sprint and adjust for the next one.
        </li>
      </ul>

                To be effective with Scrum requires something more than just following
                the mechanics and fundamentals of the framework. Sometimes Scrum
                Teamsfall into the habit of simply going through the motions.
                Professional Scrum requires mindset changes for ways of working and
                thinking, and anenvironment that supports it including trust. It also
                requires you to embrace the Scrum Values in your work. We call this
                Professional Scrum.
